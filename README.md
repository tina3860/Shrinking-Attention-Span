# Shrinking-Attention-Span


My project explores how digital media and technology have influenced the human attention span through factors like multitasking, engagement depth, and task duration. It examines smartphone usage data to analyze frequent attention-switching behaviors and studies media consumption trends through platforms like Spotify, YouTube, and TikTok, highlighting the shift toward shorter content formats. The findings reveal how this evolution affects sustained attention, with short-form, high-energy content dominating user interaction. By understanding these trends, the project offers insights for individuals to adopt mindful digital consumption practices to mitigate the negative impacts of fragmented focus and rapid media consumption.
